1. Copy project tasks/05-project-structure here.
2. Remove code of subproject that you implemented installing in previous task
3. Implement own Find<package> mechanism in copied project
4. Find library that you implemented installing by using implemented find package mechanism.
Remember about providing CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH flag to proper directory.

You can use
* CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - path where CMake looks for libraries, headers, configs
* CMAKE_MODULE_PATH - path where CMake looks for module files, find package files etc.
* IMPORTED_LOCATION - property for location of library
* INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES - property for include directories
